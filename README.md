# Machine Translation: English to French

This is the project I have built in the first course of the **NLP Nanodegree**. The course name is **Computing with Natural Language**.

# Introduction
In this notebook, I have build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. The completed pipeline has accepted English text as input and returned the French translation.

# Setup

This project requires GPU acceleration to run efficiently. 

So you can use **Amazon Web Services**. However I have implemented it in the Udacity Workkspace.


## Install
- Python 3
- NumPy
- TensorFlow 1.x
- Keras 2.x
